<h3>About me:</h3>
<div><p>I am <b>Arron Jay V. Jamora</b>, a 19-year-old second-year 
    Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student at 
    the University of the Immaculate Conception.</p>

    <br>

<h3>Favorites:</h3>
<p>In my free time, I love playing online games, sleeping, 
    and enjoying doing absolutely nothing.</p>

    <br>

<h3>School Projects:</h3>
<p> The most notable school project I have worked on was our 
    Computer Programming 2 final project, which was a group project. 
    We developed a hotel management system that included features such 
    as booking management, room availability tracking, and billing integration. 
    Each team member focused on different components, like front-end design, 
    back-end development, and database management. </p>

    <br>
<h3>Talents:</h3>
<p>I easily adjust to new scenarios, absorb information quickly, and enjoy 
    devising creative solutions to challenges.</p>
